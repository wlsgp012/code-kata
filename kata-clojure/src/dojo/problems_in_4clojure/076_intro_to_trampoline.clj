(defn trampoline'
  "trampoline can be used to convert algorithms requiring mutual
  recursion without stack consumption. Calls f with supplied args, if
  any. If f returns a fn, calls that fn with no arguments, and
  continues to repeat, until the return value is not a fn, then
  returns that non-fn value. Note that if you want to return a fn as a
  final value, you must wrap it in some data structure and unpack it
  after trampoline returns."
